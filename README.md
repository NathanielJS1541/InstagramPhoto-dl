# InstagramPhoto-dl
The purpose of this python script is to offer a method to download photos from instagram 
with an URL similar to the way that `youtube-dl` works. This is intended to be installed in
Termux on a phone with a custom `termux-url-opener` script to save instagram photos.

## **THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**
